FMessage is an IRC project to cure my boredom or to maintain my programming knowledge.
The encryption is done on the client side and the server just passes the ciphered text to the targetted client.

Updates are done once a week, this program targetting a specific audience and its use its entirely up to the user.
I will post the guide when update 1 gets release. For now its only patches.

This is still in testing phase, nothing is the final product. It only becomes the final product
after i push update 1. After update 1 no more updates will happen as this is only a side project
patches maybe pushed but their only minor improvements
